"""
Multi-strategy ensemble / voting system with quality gates.
Combines signals from all 4 strategies into consensus decisions.

Quality gates (applied to ALL modes):
1. Volume chop filter: skip if volume < 50% of 20-bar avg
2. Require 2+ strategies agreeing on same direction (weighted_veto)
3. Minimum 65% confidence after merge
4. Multi-TF trend consensus (5m+1h+6h+daily): aligned +3..+8, counter -8..-15

Modes:
- "voting": Require min_votes strategies to agree on side before trading.
  Confidence = average of agreeing strategies.
- "weighted_veto": Weight-aware voting with graduated veto.
  Chosen side must have veto_ratio × opposition strength.
- "weighted": Weight each strategy by historical performance.
  Combined confidence = weighted average.
- "best": Take the highest-confidence signal.
