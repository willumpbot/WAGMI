"""
Manual Sniper Signal Filter.

Evaluates bot-generated signals for manual scalp execution.
Two modes:
- AGGRESSIVE ($100 scaling): Only fires on absolute best signals.
  High leverage (10-25x), heavy sizing (5-10% risk), strict dedup.
  Goal: compound $100 → $1000+ with 1-2 sniper trades/day.
- STANDARD ($10k+): More signals, moderate leverage/sizing.

The math for aggressive mode on $100:
- SNIPER signal: 85%+ conf, 3 agree, HYPE BUY → ~52% WR (edge weakening, was 85%)
- Reduced leverage (3-5x, was 25x) due to WR decay. Half Kelly at 52% WR = ~3x.
- Win: +$5-8 per trade. Loss: -$5-8 per trade.
- At 52% WR, 1.34 PF: modest positive EV. Vol regime matters most (High Vol PF 3.51).
- Conservative sizing until edge stabilizes. Monitor WR trend closely.

Never modifies the bot's signals or trading logic.
